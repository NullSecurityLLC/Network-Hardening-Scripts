# Network-Hardening-Scripts

Automated scripts designed to improve and enforce strong network security configurations.

## Overview

This project will consist of **200 total scripts** focused on various aspects of network hardening. These scripts are written with automation, efficiency, and security in mindâ€”ideal for sysadmins, network engineers, red teamers, or anyone looking to lock down their systems.

## Purpose

To provide a large, open-source collection of ready-to-use scripts that cover:

- Firewall configuration
- Port lockdowns
- Secure protocol enforcement
- Vulnerability mitigation
- Network monitoring enhancements
- And more as development progresses

## Project Status

- Total scripts planned: 200
- Estimated completion: 1 year
- Scripts will be released in batches as they are developed

## Availability

All scripts will be freely available here on GitHub. No paywalls. No sign-ups. Just raw, usable code to help secure your infrastructure.

## Contributions

Once the base set is complete, contributions may be accepted. Until then, this is a solo build.

## Stay Tuned

New files will drop over time.
